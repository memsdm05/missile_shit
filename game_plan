Plan: Ascii Missiles
Flux is how "big" a missile is. Your ship has a flux capacity and a flux regen.
When you launch a missile, the missile subtracts your ships flux by the sum of
the flux on the parts. The flux on your ship continually recharges based on your
regen speed. You cannot launch a missile with more flux then the shup.


Explosives/Payload
@ = HE - Instantly kills enemy in a radius -10F
* = Frag - Has a chance of killing enemies. Closer the enemy the higher the chance -7F
< = AP - Kills the enemy on hit - 1F
$ = Flare (Countermeasure) - Redirects enemy focus off you and onto it -5F

Structural - holds various amounts of fuel based on size
= = Standard Fuselage - 5F
- = Thin Fuselage - 1F
# = Thicc Fuselage - 9F

Thrust
: = Twin Mini Booster - Two low thrust boosters that increase maneuverability - 12F
. = Mini Booster - Low thrust, Low fuel consumption - 6F
> = Booster - Medium thrust, Medium fuel consumption - 17F
} = Mk2 Booster - High thrust, High fuel consumption - 35F
] = End Cap - Has no thrust value but increases yield by 1.4x. -7F

Maneuvering
{ = Swept Fins - Fins that work the best at high speeds - 5F
[ = Straight Fins - Fins that work best at low speeds - 5F
K = Hybrid Fin - Fins that work well at all speeds - 10F
| = Thrust Vectoring - Like Hybrid Fins but use fuel to maneuver - 6F

Misc
o = Cooldown Limiter - decreases flux on missiles. - -10F
Blink drives instantly teleports to an enemy. Uses a lot of fuel
) = Blink Drive 1 - First part of the Blink Drive. - 30F
( = Blink Drive 2 - Second part of the Blink Drive - 30F
